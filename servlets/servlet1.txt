Web Applications
=================
A web application is a collection of web resource programs having the capability to generate web pages.

We have two types of web pages.

1) Static web pages 
---------------------
It shows same content for every request.
ex:
	Home page 
	AboutUs page
	facebook login page 
	and etc.

2) Dynamic web pages 
------------------
It shows dynamic content for every request.
ex:
	live cricket score page 
	stock market share value page
	news page
	and etc.

We have two types of web resource programs.

1) Static web resource 
-----------------------
A web resource program which is used to develop static web pages is called static web resource program.
ex:
	HTML program 
	CSS program
	Bootstrap program 
	and etc.

2) Dynamic web resource 
------------------------
A web resource program which is used to develop dynamic web pages is called dynamic web resource program.
ex:
	servlet program 
	JSP program 
	and etc.


Web Application and Web Resource program execution
==================================================
Java application will execute manually.

Web application and web resource program execute at the time when they have requested.

Diagram: servlet1.1

With respect to the diagram:
---------------------------
1) Enduser gives the request to web resource program.

2) Web server will trap that request and passes that request to appropriate web resource program.

3) Web resource program executes the logic to process the request.

4) Web resource program communicates with database software if neccessary.

5) Web resource program gives result to web server.

6) Web server will send the output to browser window as dynamic response.


Web Server 
===========
A web server is a piece of software which is used to automate whole process of web application and web resource program execution.

ex:
	Tomcat, Resin and etc.

The process of keeping the application in the server is called deployment.
The process of removing the application from the server is called undeployment.

Responsibilies of web server
------------------------------
1) It takes continueous request from client.

2) It passes each request to appropriate web resource program.

3) It provides environment to deploy and undeploy the web application.

4) It will add middleware services only to deployed web applications.

5) It allows to execute client side web resource programs to execute in a browser window.

6) It is used to automate whole process of web application and web resource program execution.


To execute java program we required JRE/JVM.

To execute servlet program we required servlet container.

To execute JSP program we required jsp container.


Web Container
===============
A web container is a software application which manage whole life cycle of web resource program i.e from birth to death.

Servlet container manage whole life cycle of servlet program.

JSP container manage whole life cycle of jsp program.

Some part of industry considers servlet container and JSP container are web containers.

Every server is designed to support servlet container and JSP container.
