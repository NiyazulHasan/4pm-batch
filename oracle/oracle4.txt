DDL commands
=============
We have five DDL commands.

1) create  - tables 
2) alter   - columns 
3) drop    - tables 
4) truncate- rows/records 
5) rename  - tables 


2) alter command
----------------
Using alter command we can perform following activities very easily.

i) Adding the new columns 

ii) Modifying the columns 

iii) Dropping the columns 

iv) Renaming the columns 


i) Adding the new columns 
-------------------------
Using alter command we can add new columns in a existing table.

syntax:
-------
	alter table <table_name> add (col1 datatype(size)); 
ex:
	alter table student add (state varchar2(12),pincode number(8));

	update student set state='Telangana' where sno=101;


ii) Modifying the columns 
------------------------
Using alter command we can modify the columns.

We can increase or decrease the size of a column only when existing values are fit into new size.

We can change the datatype of a column only when that column is empty.

syntax:
-------
	alter table <table_name> modify (col1 datatype(size));

ex:
	desc student;
	
	alter table student modify (state varchar2(15));

	desc student;

	alter table student modify (pincode varchar2(8));

	desc student;


iii) Dropping the columns 
--------------------------
Using alter command we can drop the columns.

syntax:
-----
	alter table <table_name> drop (col_name);

ex:
	alter table student drop (pincode,state);


iv) Renaming the columns 
-------------------------
Using alter command we can rename the column name.

syntax:
------
	alter table <table_name> rename column <old_name> to <new_name>;

ex:
	alter table student rename column sadd to city;
	alter table emp rename column esal to dailywages;
	alter table emp rename column job to designation;


3) drop command
-----------------
It is used to drop the tables from database.

syntax:
	drop table <table_name>;

ex:
	drop table student;
	drop table emp;	
	drop table dept; 

4) truncate command
--------------------
A truncate command is used to delete the rows permanently.

syntax:
	truncate table <table_name>;
ex:
	truncate table student;
	truncate table dept;
	truncate table emp; 


Q) What is the difference between delete and truncate command?

delete 						truncate 
------------					-----------
It is a DML command.				It is a DDL command.

It is used to delete the records temperory.	It is used to delete the records permanently.

We can rollback the data.			We can't rollback the data.

Where clause can be used.			Where clause can't be used.



5) rename command
-----------------
It is used to rename the table name.

syntax:
------
	rename <old_name> to <new_name>;

ex:
	rename emp to employees;
	rename student to students;
	rename dept to department;


Copy of a table or duplicate table
=================================
Using create and select command we can create a copy of a table or duplicate table.
ex:
	create table employee as select * from emp;
		
	create table employee as select eid,ename,esal from emp;

	create table employee as select * from emp where deptno=10;

	create table employee as select * from emp where eid IN(201,202,203);

	create table employee as select * from emp where esal>=20000 and esal<=50000;

	create table employee as select * from emp where comm is null;

	create table employee as select * from emp where ename like 'A%';


cl scr
=====
It is used to clear the output screen of SQL command prompt.
ex:
	cl  scr 


Functions
=========
We have two types of functions.

1) Group functions  / Multiple row functions
 
2) Scalar functions / Single row functions 


1) Group functions
--------------------
Group functions are applicable for multiple rows.

We have following list of group functions.

ex:
	sum(), avg(), max(), min(), count(*) and count(expression).


Q) Write a query to display sum of salary of each employee?

	select sum(esal) from emp;


Q) Write a query to display average salary of each employee?

	select avg(esal) from emp;


Q) Write a query to display highest salary from emp table?

	select max(esal) from emp;	


q) Write a query to display minimum salary from emp table/

	select min(esal) from emp;


Q) What is the difference between count(*) and count(expression) ? 

count(*) 
---------
It will return number of records present in a database table.
It includes null records.
ex:
	select count(*) from emp;

count(expression)
-----------------
It will return number of values present in a database table column.
It won't include null values.
ex:
	select count(eid) from emp; // 6 

	select count(comm) from emp; // 5 


Dual table
===========
Dual table is a dummy table.

It contains one row and one column.

It is used to perform arithmetic operations and to see the current system date.

ex:
	select 10+20 from dual;	
	select 10*2 from dual;	
	select sysdate from dual;
	select current_date from dual;
