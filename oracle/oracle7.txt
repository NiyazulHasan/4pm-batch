Sequence
=========
Sequence is an object which is used to generate the numbers.

syntax:
-------
	create sequence <sequence_name> start with value increment by value;

ex:
	create sequence sq1 start with 1 increment by 1;
	create sequence sq2 start with 101 increment by 1;
	create sequence sq3 start with 10 increment by 10;

Sequence having two pseudo's.

1) NEXTVAL

2) CURRVAL 

1) NEXTVAL
-----------
	It is used to generate next number in a sequence.
	ex:
		create sequence sq1 start with 101 increment by 1;

		drop table student;

		create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

		insert into student values(sq1.NEXTVAL,'raja','hyd');

		insert into student values(sq1.NEXTVAL,'ravi','delhi');

		insert into student values(sq1.NEXTVAL,'ramana','vizag');

		commit;

2) CURRVAL 
----------
	It is used to return last number which is generated by sequence.		
	ex:
		select sq1.CURRVAL from dual;


Q) Write a query to display the list sequences present in database?

	select sequence_name from user_sequences;	

Q) Write a query to drop the sequence?

	drop sequence sq1;

TCL commands
=============
We have three TCL commands.

1) commit 

2) rollback 

3) savepoint 

1) commit 
---------
It is used to make the changes permanent to database.

ex:
	drop table student;
	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));
	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');
	insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');
	commit;
	select * from student; // 2 records 

2) rollback 
-----------
It is used to undo the changes which are not permanent.

ex:
	drop table student;
	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');
	insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');
	
	select * from student; // 2 records 

	rollback;

	select * from student; // 0 records 


3) savepoint 
------------
It is used to make logical transaction marking in a database table.

Instead of complete rollback we can rollback upto savepoint.

syntax:
	savepoint  <savepoint_name>;

ex:
---
	drop table student;

	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');
	insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');

	savepoint sp1;

	insert into student values(103,'John','USA');
	insert into student values(104,'Jack','AUS');

	savepoint sp2;

	insert into student values(105,'Lisa','Iran');
	insert into student values(106,'Ana','Italy');

	select * from student; // 6 records 

	rollback to sp2;
	
	select * from student; // 4 records 


DCL 
=====
We have two types of DCL commands.

1) grant 

2) revoke


Schema
------
	Schema is a memory location which is used to run SQL commands.

Privileges
----------
	Permission given to a user is called privileges.

	Rights given to a user is called privileges.

	We have two types of privileges.

	1) System privilege :

		Permission given by DBA to user.

	2) Object privilege 
		
		Permission given by one user to another user.
		
1) grant 
--------
It is used to grant the permission to the user.

syntax:
------
	grant <privilege1>,<privilege2> to <user_name>;


2) revoke
-----------
It is used to revoke the permission from the user.

syntax:
------
	revoke <privilege1>,<privilege2> from <user_name>;


DBA> create user sai identified by sai;

DBA> create user srikanth identified by srikanth;

DBA> grant connect,resource to sai,srikanth;


SAI>  conn  sai/sai 

Srikanth> conn srikanth/srikanth 


SAI> 

create table employee(eid number(3),ename varchar2(10),esal number(8));

insert into employee values(201,'Alan',1000);
insert into employee values(202,'Jose',2000);
insert into employee values(203,'Nelson',3000);

commit;


SAI>  grant select on employee to srikanth;


srikanth>  select * from sai.employee;

srikanth>  delete from sai.employee; //insufficient privileges

SAI> grant delete on employee to srikanth;

srikanth>  delete from sai.employee; 
srikanth>  commit;

SAI >  select * from employee;

SAI >  revoke select,delete on employee from srikanth;

SRIKANTH>  disc 
SAI> disc 

DBA> revoke connect,resource from sai,srikanth;
