=======

Types of Data
==============
We have two types of data.

1) Unstructured data 

2) Structured data 

1) Unstructured data 
---------------------
A data which is not in readable format is called unstructured data.

In general, meaning less data is called unstructured data.

ex:
	201	Lakemba 	SYD	NSW	AUS
	

2) Structured data
------------------
A data which is in readable format is called structured data.

In general, meaning full data is called structured data.

ex:
	Unit	Locality	City	State	Country
	----	--------	----	-----	-------	
	201	Lakemba 	SYD	NSW	AUS

Oracle 
======
Oracle is one of the database which is used to store structured data.

Oracle is a product of Oracle Corporation.

Oracle is classified into two types.

ex:
				Oracle
				  |
	|----------------------------------------------------------|
	SQL							PL/SQL
(Structured Query Language)		(Procedural Language Extension to Structured Query Language)

Management System
================
Using Management system we can perform following activities very easily.

1) Adding the new data 

2) Modifying the existing data 

3) Deleting the unnecessary 

4) Selecting the required data 


Q) What is the difference between DBMS and RDBMS?

DBMS						RDBMS
----------					----------
It stands for Database Management System.	It stands for Relational Database Menagement System.

It stores the data in a file.			It stores the data in a table.	

It is not designed to store large amount	It is designed to store large amount of data. 
of data.

It provides support for one user at a time.	It provides supports for multiple users at a time.

There is no data security.			There is a high data security.

It does not support normalization.		It supports normalization.


Client-Server Architecture
===========================
In this architecture we will see how our data will store from frontend to backend.

Diagram: oracle1.1

Frontend
--------
The one which is visible to the enduser to perform some operations is called frontend.
ex:
	Java,.Net,Python,Perl and etc.

Communication channel
---------------------
It acts like a bridge between frontend and backend.
ex:
	JDBC - Java Database Connectivity
	ODBC - Open Database Connectivity 
	PDBC - Python Database Connectivity 

BackEnd
------
The one which is not visible to the enduser but it performs some operations based on the instructions 
given by frontend is called backend.
ex:
	Oracle, MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, DB2 , Sybase , Teradata and etc.

SQL
===
SQL stands for Structured Query Language which pronounce as SEQUEL.

This language is used to communicate with oracle database.

It is a case insensitive language.

It is a command based language.

Every command must starts with verb i.e select, insert, update , delete , merge and etc.

Every command must ends with semicolon(;).

It is developed by Mr.Codd in the year of 1972 (By IBM).


Sub languages of SQL
======================
We have five sub languages of SQL.

1) DDL  (Data Definition Language)
2) DML  (Data Manipulation Language)
3) DRL/DQL (Data Retrieve/Query Language)
4) TCL  (Transaction Control Language)
5) DCL  (Data Control Language)

1) DDL  (Data Definition Language)
--------------------------------
This language is used to maintain the objects in a database.
It is a collection of five commands.
ex:
	create,alter,drop,truncate and rename.

2) DML  (Data Manipulation Language)
--------------------------------------
This language is used to manipulate the data present in database.
It is a collection of four commands.
ex:
	insert, update , delete and merge 


3) DRL/DQL (Data Retrieve/Query Language)
------------------------------------------
This language is used to retrieve the data from database.
It is a collection of one command.
ex:
	select 

4) TCL  (Transaction Control Language)
-----------------------------------
This language is used to maintain the transaction of database.
It is a collection of three commands.
ex:
	commit, rollback and savepoint 


5) DCL  (Data Control Language)
----------------------------
This language is used to control the access of the data to the user.
It is a collection of two commands.
ex:
	grant and revoke 


Table
=====
A table is an object which is used to represent the data.

A table is a collection of rows and columns.

A data which is stored in a table is a case sensitive.

ex:
	No		Name		Add
	----------------------------------------
	101	|	Alan	|	Texas
	----------------------------------------
	102	|	Jose	|	Florida
	----------------------------------------
	103	|	Nelson	|	Vegas
	----------------------------------------

	Here we have 3 rows and 3 columns.
