2) Scalar functions
======================
Scalar functions are applicable for single row.

It is divided into four types.

i) Character functions 

ii) Number functions 

iii) Date functions 

iv) Conversion functions 


i) Character functions 
-----------------------
We have following list of character functions.

1) upper()
---------
	It is used to convert the string in uppercase.
	ex:
		select upper('oracle training') from dual;

2) lower()
---------
	It is used to convert the string in lowercase.
	ex:
		select lower('ORACLE TRAINING') from dual;

3) initcap() 
------------
	It is used to convert the string in initcap.
	ex:
		select initcap('oracle training') from dual;

4) lpad()
--------
	It is used to pad to characters to left side.
	ex:
		select lpad('oracle',10,'z') from dual; --zzzzoracle

5) rpad()
----------
	It is used to pad to characters to right side.
	ex:
		select rpad('oracle',10,'z') from dual; -- oraclezzzz

6) ltrim()
-----------
	It is used to trim the characters from left side.
	ex:
		select ltrim('zzoraclezz','z') from dual; -- oraclezz

7) rtrim()
---------
	It is used to trim the characters from left side.
	ex:
		select rtrim('zzoraclezz','z') from dual; -- zzoracle

8) trim()
----------
	It is used to trim the characters from both the sides.
	ex:
		select trim('z' from 'zzoraclezz') from dual; -- oracle

9) concat()
----------
	It is used to concatinate two strings.
	ex:
		select concat('java','developer') from dual; -- javadeveloper

10) replace() 
-----------
	It is used to replace the characters.
	ex:
		select replace('google','o','O') from dual;



ii) Number functions 
-----------------------
We have following list of number functions.

1) abs()
-------
	It returns absolute value.
	ex:
		select abs(-30) from dual;  -- 30

2) sqrt()
--------
	It returns square root value.
	ex:
		select sqrt(25) from dual;  -- 5

3) power(A,B)
-----------
	It returns power value.
	ex:
		select power(5,3) from dual; -- 125
		
4) ceil()
----------
	It returns ceil value.
	ex:
		select ceil(10.3) from dual; -- 11
		select ceil(9.9) from dual; -- 10
 

5) floor()
----------
	It returns floor value.
	ex:
		select floor(10.9) from dual; -- 10
		select floor(10.2) from dual; -- 10

6) round()
----------
	It returns nearest value.
	ex:
		select round(10.5) from dual;  -- 11
		select round(10.4) from dual;  -- 10

7) trunc() 
----------
	It is used to remove decimals.
	ex:
		select trunc(10.56) from dual; -- 10

8) greatest()
---------------
	It is used to return greatest value.
	ex:
		select greatest(10,20,30) from dual; -- 30

9) least() 
------------
	It is used to return least vaue.
	ex:
		select least(10,20,30) from dual; -- 10


Working with Date 
=================
Every database software supports date value.

Every database software contains different date patterns.
ex:
	oracle --> dd-MMM-yy
	mysql  --> yyyy-MM-dd 

ex:
--
drop table emp1;

create table emp1(eid number(3),ename varchar2(10),edoj date);

insert into emp1 values(201,'Alan','01-JAN-24');

insert into emp1 values(202,'Jose',sysdate);

insert into emp1 values(203,'Nelson',current_date);

commit;


iii) Date functions
------------------
We have following list of date functions.

1) ADD_MONTHS() 
-------------
	It is used to add the months in a given date.
	ex:
		select ADD_MONTHS('01-JAN-24',5) from dual;

2) MONTHS_BETWEEN()
------------------
	It is used to return number of months between two dates.
	ex:
		select MONTHS_BETWEEN('01-JAN-24','01-NOV-24') from dual;
		select ABS(MONTHS_BETWEEN('01-JAN-24','01-NOV-24')) from dual;

3) NEXT_DAY()
-----------
	It returns date of a given day in a week.
	ex:
		select NEXT_DAY(sysdate,'MONDAY') from dual;
		select NEXT_DAY(sysdate,'SATURDAY') from dual;


4) LAST_DAY()
------------
	It returns last date of a month.
	ex:
		select LAST_DAY(sysdate) from dual;


iv) Conversion functions
-----------------------
We have following list of conversion function.
ex:
	TO_CHAR() 

We have two pseudo's for TO_CHAR().

1) number TO_CHAR() 
--------------------
It takes '9' in digits , dollar and euro symbols.
ex:
	select eid,ename,esal from emp;
	select eid,ename,TO_CHAR(esal,'9,999') from emp;
	select eid,ename,TO_CHAR(esal,'99,999') from emp;
	select eid,ename,TO_CHAR(esal,'$99,999') from emp;
	select eid,ename,TO_CHAR(esal,'$99,999') as ESAL from emp;
	
2) Date  TO_CHAR() 
------------------
ex:
	select TO_CHAR(sysdate,'dd-MM-yyyy') from dual;
	select TO_CHAR(sysdate,'yyyy-MM-dd') from dual;
	select TO_CHAR(sysdate,'HH:MI:SS') from dual;
	select TO_CHAR(sysdate,'dd-MM-yyyy HH:MI:SS') from dual;


Interview Query
================
Q) Write a query to display employee id, employee name, employee salary and employee job from emp table?

	select eid,ename,esal,job from emp;

	select eid, 
		upper(ename) as ename,
		   TO_CHAR(esal,'$99,999') as esal,
		      lower(job) as job  from emp;


Group by clause
===============
Group by clause is used to divide the rows in to groups so that we can apply group functions.

A column which we used in select command then same colum name we need to use in group by clause.

ex:

Q) Write a query to display sum of salary of each department?

	select sum(esal),deptno from emp group by deptno;


Q) Write a query to display maximum salary of each job?

	select max(esal),job from emp group by job;


Having clause
===============
Having clause is used to filter the rows from group by clause.

Having clause must place after group by clause.

ex:
	
Q) Write a query to display sum of salary of each department where sum salary is greater then 30000?

	select sum(esal),deptno from emp group by deptno having sum(esal)>30000;


Q) Write a query to display minimum salary of each department where minimum salary must be less then 12000?

	select min(esal),deptno from emp group by deptno having min(esal)<12000;


Order by clause
=================
Order by clause is used to filter the rows in a table.

By default it will arrange the records in ascending order.

ex:
	select * from emp order by esal;

	select * from emp order by esal desc;

	select * from emp order by ename;
