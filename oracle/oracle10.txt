2) Multiple row sub query
=========================
If a sub query returns more then one row is called multiple row sub query.

To perform multiple row sub query we need to use multiple row operator.

We have three multiple row operators.

i) ANY 

ii) ALL 

iii) IN 

i) ANY
------
	select * from emp where esal > ANY (select esal from emp where deptno=10);

	select * from emp where esal < ANY (select esal from emp where deptno=10);

ii) ALL
-------
	select * from emp where esal > ALL (select esal from emp where deptno=10);

iii) IN
-------
	 select * from emp where esal IN  (select esal from emp where deptno=10);



3) Multiple column sub query
============================
If a sub query returns more then one column is called multiple column sub query.

ex:

	select * from emp where(eid,ename,esal) IN (select eid,ename,esal from emp where eid=201);

	select * from emp where(eid,ename,esal) IN (select eid,ename,esal from emp);

	select eid,ename,esal from emp where(eid,ename,esal) IN (select eid,ename,esal from emp);

Q) What is the difference between RDBMS and MongoDB? 

RDBMS						MongoDB
-----------					----------
It is a relational database.			It is a non-relational database or document based.

It does not store the data in key and value	It stores the datea in key and value pair. 
pair.

It is not suitable for hierarchical data.	It is suitable for hierarchical data.'

It contains tables.				It contains collections.

It is row based.				It is document based.

It is column based.				It is field based.

It supports SQL query language.			It supports JSON query language.

It is slower.					It is faster.


PL/SQL
=======
PL/SQL stands for Procedural language extension to Structured Query Language.

PL/SQL is a extension of SQL and it contains following features.

1) We can achieve programming features like control statements , loops and etc.

2) It reduces network traffic.

3) We can display our own error message by the concept of exception handling.

4) We can related operations by using the concept of triggers.

5) We can save the source code permenently to database for repeated execution.

PL/SQL block
============
A PL/SQL program is also known as PL/SQL block.

syntax:
	DECLARE
	-
	-	// Declaration Section 
	-
	BEGIN
	-
	-	// Executable Section 
	-
	EXCEPTION 
	-
	-	// Exception Section 
	-
	END;
	/

Declaration Section 
---------------------
Declaration section contains declaration of variables, cursors, exceptions and etc.
It is optional section.

Executable Section 
-------------------
It contains actual logic of a program, which is used to complete a table.
It is mandatory section.

Exception Section 
-----------------
This section will execute when there is a exception in a program.
It is optional section.


To see the output in PL/SQL we need to set server output environment.

ex:
	SQL> set   serveroutput  on 



Q) Write a PL/SQL program to display hello world?

	BEGIN
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Hello World');
	END;
	/

	Here '/' is used to submit the PL/SQL program in a database.


Q) Write a PL/SQL program to perform sum of two numbers?

	DECLARE 
	A number;
	B number;
	C number;
	BEGIN
	A:=10;
	B:=20;
	C:=A+B;
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(C);
	END;
	/

Declaration and Initialization using single line.

ex:
	DECLARE 
	A number:=10;
	B number:=20;
	C number:=A+B;
	BEGIN
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(C);
	END;
	/


Using '&' symbol we can read dynamic inputs.

ex:
	DECLARE 
	A number(3);
	B number(3);
	C number(6);
	BEGIN
	A:=&a;
	B:=&b;
	C:=A+B;
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('sum of two numbers is '||C);
	END;
	/
	


Using PL/SQL we can perform DML operations.

Q) Write a PL/SQL program to update student name based on student number?

	DECLARE 
	L_sno number(3);
	BEGIN
	L_sno:=&sno;
	update student set sname='raja' where sno=L_sno;
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Record Updated');
	END;
	/

Q) Write a PL/SQL program to insert student record into student table?

	BEGIN
	insert into student values(103,'ramana','vizag');
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Record Inserted');
	END;
	/


Q) Write a PL/SQL program to delete student record based on student number?
	
	DECLARE 
	L_sno number(3);
	BEGIN
	L_sno:=&sno;
	delete from student where sno=L_sno;
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Record Deleted');
	END;
	/

===================
Q) Write a java program to display butterfly loop pattern?

class Test  
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		int rows=4;

		for(int i=1;i<=rows;i++)
		{
			//left side 
			for(int j=1;j<=i;j++)
			{
				System.out.print("* ");
			}

			//space 
			for(int j=1;j<=(rows-i)*2;j++)
			{
				System.out.print("  ");
			}

			//right side 
			for(int j=i;j>=1;j--)
			{
				System.out.print("* ");
			}

			//new line
			System.out.println();
		}
		for(int i=rows-1;i>=1;i--)
		{
			//left side 
			for(int j=1;j<=i;j++)
			{
				System.out.print("* ");
			}

			//space 
			for(int j=1;j<=(rows-i)*2;j++)
			{
				System.out.print("  ");
			}

			//right side 
			for(int j=i;j>=1;j--)
			{
				System.out.print("* ");
			}

			//new line
			System.out.println();
		}
	}
}
