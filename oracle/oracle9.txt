Views
======
A view is a virtual representing of a data from one or more then one table.

syntax:
-------
	create view <view_name> as select * from <table_name>;

A table which is used to create a view is called base table or above table.


View does not consume the memory.

View does not have any data.

View gets the data when we run select command.

We have following list of views.

1) Simple view 

2) Complex view 

3) With ready only view 

4) With check option view 

5) Materialized view 



1) Simple view
---------------
If a view is created by using one base table is called simple view.

ex:
	create view v1 as select * from emp;
	create view v1 as select eid,ename,esal from emp;
	create view v1 as select * from emp where deptno=10;
	create view v1 as select * from emp where eid IN(201,202,203);

DML operations are allowed in simple view.

ex:
	delete from v1 where eid=207;

	select * from v1; //6 records 
	select * from emp; // 6 records 


2) Complex view 
----------------
If a view is created by using more then one base table is called complex view.

ex:
	create view v2 as select e.eid,e.ename,e.esal,d.dname,d.dloc from emp e, dept d
	where(e.deptno=d.deptno);

DML operations are not allowed in complex view.

ex:
	delete from v2; // cannot delete from view 



3) With ready only view 
-----------------------
If view is created by using one based  table and DML operations are not required then we need to use with read only view.

ex:
	create view v3 as select * from emp with read only;

DML operations are not allowed.
ex:
	delete from v3; // cannot delete from view 


4) With check option view 
---------------------------
If a view is created by using one base table and DML operations are allowed only if condition is true then we need to use with check option view.

ex:
	create view v4 as select * from emp where deptno=30 with check option;

DML operations are allowed ony if condition is true.
ex:
	insert into v4 values(208,'Maria',59000,60,'Salesman',200); // view with check option 

	insert into v4 values(208,'Maria',59000,30,'Salesman',200);


5) Materialized view 
--------------------
To create a materialized view a table must have primary key.

A materialized view is also known as snapshot.

ex:
	alter table emp ADD primary key(eid);	

	create materialized view v5 as select * from emp;

	select * from v5; // 8 records 

	delete from emp where eid IN (207,208);
	commit;
	select * from emp; // 6 records 

	select * from v5; // 8 records 

In order the make the changes We need to refresh the materialized view.

ex:
	exec   DBMS_SNAPSHOT.REFRESH('v5');

	select * from v5; // 6 records 

Q) Write a query to display list of views present in database?

	select view_name from user_views;

Q) Write a query to drop the view?

	drop view v1;
	drop view v2;
	drop view v3;
	drop view v4;
	drop materialized view v5;


Merge Command
==============
Merge command is a combination of insert and update command.

student10 table
----------------
drop table student10;
create table student10(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));
insert into student10 values(101,'raja','hyd'); 
insert into student10 values(102,'ravi','delhi'); 
insert into student10 values(103,'ramana','vizag');
commit;
 
student20 table
--------------
drop table student20;
create table student20(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));
insert into student20 values(103,'Alan','Texas'); 
insert into student20 values(104,'Jose','Florida'); 
commit;

ex:
	merge into student10 s1
	using student20 s2
	ON(s1.sno=s2.sno)
	when matched then 
	update set sname=s2.sname,sadd=s2.sadd
	when not matched then 
	insert (sno,sname,sadd) values(s2.sno,s2.sname,s2.sadd);


	select * from student10; // 2 rows merged 
	
	select * from student20;

Sub Queries
===========
Sometimes we will declare a query inside another query such concept is called sub query.

In sub query , first inner query will execute then parent parent query.

Sub query is used to select the records based on unknown values.

Sub query can be nested upto 32 levels.

We have following list of sub queries.

1) Single row sub query 

2) Multiple row sub query 

3) Multiple column sub query 

1) Single row sub query 
-----------------------
If a sub query returns only one row is called single row sub query.

ex:
	normal query
	-----------
	select * from emp where eid=201;

	sub query 
	---------
	select * from emp where eid=(select eid from emp where ename='Alan');

ex:
---
	normal query
	--------
	select * from emp where eid=201 and ename='Alan';

	sub query
	--------
	select * from emp where 
	eid=(select eid from emp where ename='Alan')
	and 
	ename=(select ename from emp where esal=9000);


Q) Write a query to display employees information whose salary is greater then Mark salary?

	select * from emp where esal>(select esal from emp where ename='Mark');


Q) Write a query to display second highest salary from emp table?

	select max(esal) from emp where esal<(select max(esal) from emp);
