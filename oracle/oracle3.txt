update command
==============
It is used to update/modify the records in a database table.

syntax:
	update <table_name> set <col_name>=value where condition; 
ex:
	update student set sname='rajesh' where sno=104;

	update student set sname='Alan',sadd='Florida' where sno=104;

Note:
-----
	If we won't use where clause then all rows will be updated.

	ex:
		update student set sno=101;
		
		update student set sno=101,sname='raja';
		
		rollback;

Delete command
==============
It is used to delete the records from database table.

syntax:
-----
	delete from <table_name> where condition;

ex:
	delete from student where sno=104;

	delete from student where sname='raja';

	delete from student where sadd='vizag';

	rollback; 

Note:
----
	If we won't use where clause then all rows will be deleted.
	ex:
		delete from student;
		delete from emp;
		delete from dept; 
		rollback;

Logical Operators
=================
Logical operators are used to declare multiple conditions in where clause.

We have three logical operators.

1) AND 

2) OR 

3) NOT

1) AND 
--------
It returns the records only if both condition is true.

Here conditions must be from same row only.

ex:
---
	select * from emp where eid=201 AND ename='Alan';

	select * from emp where eid=209 AND ename='Mark';

	select * from emp where eid=201 AND ename='Mark';

2) OR 
-------
It returns the records atleast one condition is true.

Here conditions can be from any row.

ex:
	select * from emp where eid=201 OR ename='Alan';

	select * from emp where eid=201 OR ename='Mark';

	select * from emp where eid=209 OR ename='Mark';

3) NOT
------
It returns the records except the condition.

A '<>' symbol denoted as NOT operator.

ex:

	select * from emp where NOT eid=201;
	select * from emp where eid<>201;


	select * from emp where NOT ename='Jose';
	select * from emp where ename<>'Jose';


Between operator
================
Between operators is used to return the records in the range of values.

In between operator we will take lower limit then higher limit.

A between operator takes the support of AND operator.

ex:
	select * from emp where eid between 201 AND 206;

	select * from emp where esal between 5000 AND 25000;

	
IN operator
===========
IN operator is a replacement of OR operator.

It returns the records those who are matching in the list of values.

ex:
	select * from emp where eid IN (201,202,203,204);

	select * from emp where ename IN ('Alan','Jose','Julie');


Interview Questions
====================

	select * from emp where deptno IN (10,20,30);	


Q) Write a query to display list of employees whose salary in the range of 10000 AND 40000?

	select * from emp where esal between 10000 AND 40000;


Q) Write a query to delete employees whose employee id 201,202 and 203?

	delete from emp where eid IN (201,202,203);



Core Java Interview question
============================
Q) Write a java program to display the string in a given format?

input:
	NEX123

Output:
	Number of Digits: 3
	sum of Digits : 6 
	It is even number 

ex:
--
class Test  
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		String str="NEX123";

		String substr=str.replaceAll("[^0-9]","");

		int sum=0;

		for(int i=0;i<substr.length();i++)  // 1 2 3
		{
			int n=Character.getNumericValue(substr.charAt(i));
			sum+=n;
		}

		System.out.println("Number of Digits : "+substr.length()); //3
		System.out.println("Sum of Digits :"+ sum); // 6

		if(sum%2==0)
			System.out.println("It is even number");
		else
			System.out.println("It is odd number");
	}
}

Pattern Matching operators
==========================
Pattern matching operators are used to select the letters from database table.

We have two pattern matching operators.

1) Percentage(%)

2) Underscore(_) 


1) Percentage(%)
------------------
Q) Write a query to display employee information whose employee name starts with 'J' letter?

	select * from emp where ename like 'J%';


Q) Write a query to display employee information whose employee name ends with 'n' letter?

	select * from emp where ename like '%n';


Q) Write a query to display employee information whose employee name having middle letter as 'l'?

	select * from emp where ename like '%l%';


2) Underscore(_) 
-----------------

Q) Write a query to display employee information whose employee name having second letter as 'l'?

	select * from emp where ename like '_l%';


Q) Write a query to display employee information whose employee name having second last letter as 'o'?

	select * from emp where ename like '%o_';


Q) Write a query to display employee information whose employee name having third letter as 'r'?

	select * from emp where ename like '__r%';
